Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
I have developed an inventory system that includes the essential features needed in a stock tracking application. In addition, it allows users who want to manage multiple inventories to do so separately. With this system, a user can keep track of multiple different stocks within the same program and switch between them easily.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The inventory selection and addition screen after login was the most important screen to meet this need. I aimed to keep this screen as simple and understandable as possible, and I decided to perform the addition process within a different fragment on the same screen without navigating to another one. This might be where my design is most successful.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
While developing this project, due to significant time constraints, I deviated from my usual development process and jumped straight into coding. This was a big risk, but it was a calculated one. In the project management triangle of time, quality, and cost, I decided to compromise on quality because I had limited time, and the cost of not delivering the project would be too high. This triangle is also known as the "impossible trinity," meaning it is never possible to achieve all three aspects simultaneously. However, I still approached the development process step by step. First, I gathered some necessary information and took notes, such as how to pass data between intents and fragments, how to check for SMS sending, how to request SMS permissions, how to send SMS, and how to use callbacks to refresh a page after an operation. I researched these key areas in advance, made notes, and then applied them piece by piece, progressing slowly. I believe this was the best approach I could have taken.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
While developing the program, I only had the opportunity to perform developer testing and functional testing. I wasn't able to conduct the remaining tests, which means I could only check whether the code failed in any scenario and whether it performed the required tasks. I wasn't able to carry out the other tests due to time constraints. For these tests, I tested the code with different data and scenarios and concluded that the two tests were successful. If we develop an application without conducting these tests, we won't know in which situations the application might fail, and as a result, users may abandon the application, leading to a loss of market share. Therefore, these tests should be conducted on time, and any resulting errors should be corrected.

Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
Specifically speaking about this project, I need to be more successful in time management and work on improving myself in this area.

what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience ?
This project turned out to be quite monotonous, with no specific area where I could showcase my skills. However, I can say that I was successful in identifying user needs and implementing features that are not present in other applications on the market, which could attract user interest. Specifically, I succeeded in adding the feature of managing multiple inventories, which distinguishes this project.
